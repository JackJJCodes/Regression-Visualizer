# Workflow:
1. I have used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">**Tensorflow.js**</a> for this visualization. Tensorflow.js is a library made in Javascript, for performing Machine and Deep Learning tasks!
2. For visualization, I have used the <a href="https://p5js.org/">**p5.js**</a> library. P5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!
3. I have also implemented Polynomial Regression using Tensorflow.js and p5.js. I will be putting up more visualizations soon!.
